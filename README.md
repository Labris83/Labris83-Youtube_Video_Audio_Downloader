## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [`yt_dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/)(download it from the OFFICIAL WEBSITE)*(required for best quality)*


This project uses the following open-source tools:

- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

## Required Python package(s)

## The purpose and the future of the project

This tool was intended for my personal use, so I will probably try to keep the code functional with the upcoming versions and changes of yt-dlp and ffmpeg. 
I also plan to add GUI into this project, but for now it will remain a command-line based tool.
